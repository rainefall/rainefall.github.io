                <h2>In Dreams - Released 2022/05/04</h2>
                <p class="albumdesc">
                    This was a little cover EP of songs I deemed to be (almost) thematically consistent (the exception is Wet Hands, which I picked mostly because it is my girlfriend's favourite song from the Minecraft soundtrack). Recording it was an interesting process for me, not only did I partially reinvent my sound while recording it, but it was also my first experience with vocal recording and production.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>I Feel You</b>, the first and 100% not the last of Depeche Mode covers by myself. I adore this song, always felt it had the potential to go in a harder alt rock direction than the original (I was partially inspired by legendary alt rock guitarist Johnny Marr's cover he did for record store day 2015). Released as a single a week prior to this EP's release because I wanted to release a version with an actual ending and not just a crossfade to the next track...<br>
                    <br>
                    ...<b>Digital Love</b>... a more "New Wave" ode to legendary French House duo Daft Punk. I don't own a talk box so the vocals aren't particularly authentic, and were also a pain to record due to my rather unfortunate deeper voice.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Wet Hands</b> is a short instrumental break before the lyrical tone of the EP shifts from optimistic to.. not. Quite a different take on the original, being a traditional synthwave style over the raw piano of the original.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Endlessly</b> is also quite a radically different take on the original. It was also the first track I started working on, though the vocals were finished last due to it being an incredibly difficult song for me to sing.<br> 
                    <br>
                    <b>Only In Dreams</b> is the namesake of this album, and a potentially odd choice of song. Weezer have a bit of a reputation for being a bit of a meme band, especially given their output post reuniting in the early 2000s. But I do think this is a very powerful song, and a fitting conclusion to this EP which slowly loses its optimism over the course of 24 minutes.<br>
