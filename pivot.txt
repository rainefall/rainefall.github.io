Pivot is a multiplayer online battle arena, developed in 9 days for a game jam by a few friends of mine. After the game jam ended, the game continued to receive updates, and this is where I became involved. There were a number of issues that required additions to the engine the game ran on, an RPG Maker XP reimplementation called mkxp-z. This led me to create a fork of mkxp-z, with integrated Discord support and the ability for developers to define Ruby code that is run when the game is shut down (used by Pivot to destroy a lobby if the game is shut down improperly).
